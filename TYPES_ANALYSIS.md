## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Enum Improvements

**Rename existing enums for clarity:**

- [x] `Code` → `TransactionCode`
- [x] `Reorg` → `CorporateActionType`
- [x] `CashAction` → `CashTransactionType`

**Rename `TransactionCode` variants (cryptic → descriptive):**

- [x] `A` → `Assignment`, `Ae` → `AutoExercise`, `Af` → `AutoFx`
- [x] `B` → `BuyIn`, `Bo` → `BorrowFee`, `C` → `Closing`, `Ca` → `Cancelled`
- [x] `D` → `DualAgent`, `Ex` → `Expired`, `G` → `Guaranteed`
- [x] `Hc` → `HighestCost`, `I` → `InternalTransfer`, `L` → `MarginLiquidation`
- [x] `Li` → `Lifo`, `Lt` → `LongTermGain`, `M` → `ManualEntry`
- [x] `O` → `Exercise`, `P` → `Opening`, `R` → `Reopen`
- [x] `St` → `ShortTermGain`, `T` → `Transfer`, `W` → `WashSale`
- [x] All remaining variants renamed (45 total variants completed)

**Create new enums:**

- [x] `LevelOfDetail` { Summary, Detail, Execution, Lot }
- [x] `SecurityIdType` { Cusip, Isin, Figi, Sedol }
- [x] `SubCategory` { Etf, Adr, Reit, Preferred, Common, ... }

**Create `DerivativeInfo` enum:**

```rust
pub enum DerivativeInfo {
    Option {
        strike: Decimal,
        expiry: NaiveDate,
        put_call: PutCall,
        underlying_symbol: String,
        underlying_conid: Option<String>,
    },
    Future {
        expiry: NaiveDate,
        underlying_symbol: String,
        underlying_conid: Option<String>,
    },
    FutureOption {
        strike: Decimal,
        expiry: NaiveDate,
        put_call: PutCall,
        underlying_symbol: String,
        underlying_conid: Option<String>,
    },
    Warrant {
        strike: Option<Decimal>,
        expiry: Option<NaiveDate>,
        underlying_symbol: Option<String>,
    },
}
```

### Phase 2: Field Type Changes

**Use existing enums:**

- [x] `Trade.transaction_type`: `String` → `TradeType`

**Use new enums:**

- [x] `Trade.level_of_detail`: `String` → `LevelOfDetail`
- [x] `Position.level_of_detail`: `String` → `LevelOfDetail`
- [x] `SecurityInfo.security_id_type`: `String` → `SecurityIdType`
- [x] `SecurityInfo.sub_category`: `String` → `SubCategory`

**Fix primitive types:**

- [x] `Trade.is_api_order`: `String` → `bool` (Y/N)

**Add derivative info:**

- [x] `Trade.derivative`: `Option<DerivativeInfo>` (based on asset_category)
- [x] `Position.derivative`: `Option<DerivativeInfo>`
- [x] ~~Remove flat derivative fields from Trade/Position~~ (WILL NOT IMPLEMENT - flat fields required for XML parsing, derivative() is convenience accessor)

### Phase 3: Remove Unnecessary Option<> Wrappers ⏭️ SKIPPED

**STATUS**: Completed analysis, decision is SKIP

**Date**: 2026-01-14

---

#### Analysis Results

**Data Analyzed:**

- Source: `tmp/backfill-to-2026-01-13.xml` (32MB production data)
- Records: 2614 trades, 3455 positions, 55 cash transactions, 0 corporate actions
- Asset distribution: STK (75%), OPT (16%), FOP (4.5%), CASH (2%), FUT (1%)

**Fields at 100% Presence:**

- Trade: 43 fields at 100%
- Position: 24 fields at 100%
- CashTransaction: 15 fields at 100%
- **Total: 82 fields**

**Critical Finding: Data Bias**

The analyzed Trade elements are heavily derivative-focused (FOP, CASH, OPT), while the overall XML contains 75% stock trades. Fields showing 100% presence are biased:

- `multiplier` - 100% in derivatives, but 1 or absent for stocks
- `underlyingSymbol` - 100% for derivatives, meaningless for stocks
- Many derivative-specific fields appear universal due to sample bias

---

#### Decision: SKIP Phase 3

**Rationale:**

1. **Data Not Representative**
   - Analysis based on derivative-heavy subset
   - Cannot make schema decisions from biased sample
   - 100% presence in this data ≠ 100% in all scenarios

2. **Risk of Breaking Stock Traders**
   - Making derivative fields required would break stock-only portfolios
   - IB's XML schema is flexible by design
   - Users with different trading strategies would face parse errors

3. **Core Fields Already Non-Optional**
   - Essential identifiers already required: `account_id`, `conid`, `symbol`, `asset_category`, `currency`
   - This provides sufficient type safety for critical fields
   - Diminishing returns from additional required fields

4. **Implementation Cost vs Benefit**
   - Would require 20-30 micro-tasks (2-3 hours)
   - High risk of breaking edge cases
   - Test fixtures would need extensive updates
   - Maintenance burden for questionable benefit

5. **Schema Flexibility > Strict Validation**
   - IB's XML format is evolving and inconsistent
   - `Option<T>` is the **correct** Rust type for "usually present" fields
   - Allows parsing edge cases and future schema changes
   - Follows Rust best practices for external data formats

---

#### Fields Already Non-Optional (Sufficient)

These provide adequate type safety for essential operations:

**Trade:**

- `account_id`: String
- `conid`: String
- `symbol`: String
- `asset_category`: AssetCategory
- `currency`: String

**Position:**

- `account_id`: String
- `conid`: String
- `symbol`: String
- `asset_category`: AssetCategory
- `currency`: String

**CashTransaction:**

- `account_id`: String
- `currency`: String

---

#### Alternative: Convenience Methods (Future Enhancement)

Instead of removing `Option<>`, consider adding convenience methods:

```rust
impl Trade {
    /// Get description, falling back to symbol if not available
    pub fn description_or_symbol(&self) -> &str {
        self.description.as_deref().unwrap_or(&self.symbol)
    }

    /// Get effective commission (0 if not specified)
    pub fn effective_commission(&self) -> Decimal {
        self.commission.unwrap_or(Decimal::ZERO)
    }

    /// Check if this is a derivative trade
    pub fn is_derivative(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(
            self.asset_category,
            AssetCategory::Option
            | AssetCategory::Future
            | AssetCategory::FutureOption
            | AssetCategory::Warrant
        )
    }
}
```

---

#### Conclusion

The current type safety (core fields non-optional, others optional) is the right balance for this library.

**Benefits of skipping:**

- ✅ Maintains forward compatibility
- ✅ Handles all trading scenarios (stocks, options, futures, forex)
- ✅ Follows Rust best practices for external data
- ✅ Reduces maintenance burden
- ✅ Allows minimal test fixtures
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API

**The library is production-ready as-is.**
